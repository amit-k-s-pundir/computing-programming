# A very simple obfuscation filter -- turn an HTML document into a one liner, which will
# make it harder to read its source without a special processing. To accomplish
# that we are going to remove characters \012 (\n) and \015 (\r), which depending
# on the platform alone or as a combination represent the end of line and a
# carriage return.
