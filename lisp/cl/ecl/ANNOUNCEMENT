Announcement of ECL v0.9l
=========================

ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project aims to produce
an implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies to the ANSI
X3J13 definition of the language.

The term embeddable refers to the fact that ECL includes a lisp to C
compiler, which produces libraries (static or dynamic) that can be
called from C programs. Furthermore, ECL can produce standalone
executables from your lisp code and can itself be linked to your
programs as a shared library.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris (at least v. 9), Microsoft Windows and OSX, running on top of
the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and PowerPC processors. Porting to other
architectures should be rather easy.

ECL is currently hosted at Common-Lisp.net and SourceForge. The home
page of the project is http://ecls.sourceforge.net, and in it you will
find source code releases, a CVS tree and some useful documentation.


Notes for this release
======================

This release is relevant for various reasons. First of all, several
important bugs have been fixed which now allow Maxima to be built
using ECL. Second, there have been serious improvements in performance
coming mainly from a better garbage collector scheme (incremental
with generations) and a threaded interpreter. In some cases this results
in a factor 2 reduction in execution time.
