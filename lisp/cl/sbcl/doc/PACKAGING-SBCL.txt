Packaging SBCL
==============

If you package SBCL for a distribution, please edit version.lisp-expr,
and append ".packaging-target-or-patch[.version]".

Examples:

 "1.0.7.gentoo"
 "1.0.7.mikes-rpms.2"

This will make the startup banner, --version, and
(lisp-implementation-version) all identify the packaged version
correctly.

We ask you to do this because users report bugs that are intimately
tied up with configuration issues at regular intervals, and much
confusion can result from mistaking a packaged SBCL for the upstream
one.
