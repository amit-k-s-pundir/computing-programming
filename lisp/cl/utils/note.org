This directory contains various general/generic utilities libraries for CL. In
case those libraries are acturally scattered elsewhere in the file system, this
directory contains the symlink to them. Remember that the
~/workspace/programming/utils/ dir in turn contains the most generally useful
libraries/apps which are actually located elsewhere (e.g. in this dir).
